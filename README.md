Dictionary does not renew the Datasource
 
https://forum.stimulsoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=38579

Example report is in ReportDesignerExample\examplereports\ReportDictionary.mrt
it contains columns 'id' and 'name'

The code DataTable mock has only 'id'

By loading the report, the dictionary should be refreshed and contain only 'id' but it does not happen.

Method to start debugging is ReportDesigner.LoadStiReport
